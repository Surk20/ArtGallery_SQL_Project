        <p> <i>Art galleries are spaces for displaying, promoting, and sometimes selling artworks.A website
             for an art gallery is built to increase visibility by reaching a 
             global audience beyond the physical location, showcase artworks by displaying current and 
             past exhibitions online, facilitate sales by enabling online purchasing of artworks, and provide 
             information by sharing details about the gallery.They come in various forms, such as commercial galleries (selling art), 
             public galleries (non-profit and educational), artist-run spaces, and virtual galleries.</i>
